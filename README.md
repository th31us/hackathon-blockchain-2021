# Hackathon Project: Improve Data Collection Across the Health Care System Especially in Emergency Services

<h2>PURPOSE</h2>

Team Crypto-Maniacs' submission to Babylon Project 2.0 World Blockchain Hackathon 2021

<h2>PROJECT SUMMARY</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>
To improve the data collection and transmission process across the health care system, especially with emergency services

<h3>Background</h3>
Hospitals rely on accurate patient data to determine important outcome measures in evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of health services. Therefore, the collection of data is essential in helping hospitals to make critical decisions. 

<h3>Objective</h3>
To determine if an electronic patient pre-fill data collection web application is effective in the data collection method for key hospital outcome measures when compared with alternative hospital data collection methods, such as completing paper forms upon arrival at the hospital. The web application will provide patients who need emergency services with the option to complete basic patient data, including the reason for their ER visit. The data collected from the web app will be transmitted to the hospital to notify them of an incoming patient.
